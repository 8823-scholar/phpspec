Installation
============

**phpspec** is a php 5.3 library that you'll have in your project
development environment. Before you begin, ensure that you have at least
PHP 5.3.3 installed.

Method #1 (Composer)
--------------------

The simplest way to install phpspec with all its dependencies is through
Composer:

Create a ``composer.json`` file in the project root:

.. code-block:: js

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "phpspec/phpspec": "~2.0"
        },
        "config": {
            "bin-dir": "bin"
        },
        "autoload": {"psr-0": {"": "src"}}
    }

Then download the ``composer.phar`` and run the ``install`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar install

Everything will be installed inside the ``vendor`` folder and a phpspec executable will
be linked into the ``bin`` folder.
